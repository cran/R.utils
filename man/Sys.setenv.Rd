\description{
  If you searched for help on \code{\link[base]{Sys.setenv}} but got this page
  instead, you are most likely running R v2.5.0 or newer.  Then, see
  the above link or \code{help(Sys.setenv, package="base")}.

  The reason for adding the same to this package is that in R v2.4.x only
  \code{Sys.putenv()} is available.  To make this package work on both
  system, \code{Sys.setenv()} is set to \code{Sys.putenv()} on R v2.4.x
  and needs to be document in order for the package to pass the tests.
