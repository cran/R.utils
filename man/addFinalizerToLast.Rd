\title{Modifies .Last() to call 'finalizeSession()}

\description{
  Modifies .Last() to call 'finalizeSession() \emph{before} calling the default \code{.Last()} function.

  Note that \code{.Last()} is \emph{not} guaranteed to be called when
  the \R session finished.  For instance, the user may quit \R by calling
  \code{quit(runLast=FALSE)} or run R in batch mode.

  Note that this function is called when the R.utils package is loaded.

\value{
  Returns (invisibly) \code{\link[base:logical]{TRUE}} if \code{.Last()} was modified,
  otherwise \code{\link[base:logical]{FALSE}}.
