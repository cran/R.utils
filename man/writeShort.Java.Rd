\title{Writes a short (16 bits) to a connection in Java format}

\description{
  Writes one or several short's (16 bits) to a connection in Java
  format so they will be readable by Java.
  All data types in Java are signed, i.e. a byte can hold a value in
  the range [-32768,32767]. Trying to write a value outside this range
  will automatically be truncated without a warning.
