  Opens a new device.

 \usage{devNew(type=getOption("device"), ..., scale=1, aspectRatio=1, par=NULL, label=NULL)}

 \arguments{
   \item{type}{A \code{\link[base]{character}} string specifying the type of device to be
     opened. This string should match the name of an existing device
     \code{\link[base]{function}}.}
   \item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the device \code{\link[base]{function}}, e.g.
     \code{width} and \code{height}.  If not given, the are inferred
     from \code{\link{devOptions}}().}
   \item{scale}{A \code{\link[base]{numeric}} scalar factor specifying how much the
     width and the height should be rescaled.}
   \item{aspectRatio}{A \code{\link[base]{numeric}} ratio specifying the aspect ratio
     of the image.  See below.}
   \item{par}{An optional named \code{\link[base]{list}} of graphical settings applied,
     that is, passed to \code{\link[graphics]{par}}, immediately after
     opening the device.}
   \item{label}{An optional \code{\link[base]{character}} string specifying the label of the
     opened device.}
 }

 \value{
   Returns what the device \code{\link[base]{function}} returns.
 }

 \section{Width and heights}{
   The default width and height of the generated image is specific to
   the type of device used.  There is not straightforward programatical
   way to infer these defaults; here we use \code{\link{devOptions}}(), which
   in most cases returns the correct defaults.
 }

 \section{Aspect ratio}{
   The aspect ratio of an image is the height relative to the width.
   If argument \code{height} is not given (or \code{\link[base]{NULL}}), it is
   calculated as \code{aspectRatio*width} as long as they are given.
   Likewise, if argument \code{width} is not given (or \code{\link[base]{NULL}}), it is
   calculated as \code{width/aspectRatio} as long as they are given.
   If neither \code{width} nor \code{height} is given, then \code{width}
   defaults to \code{devOptions(type)$width}.
   If both \code{width} and \code{height} are given, then
   \code{aspectRatio} is ignored.
