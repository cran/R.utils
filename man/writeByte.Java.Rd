\title{Writes a byte (8 bits) to a connection in Java format}

\description{
  Writes one or several byte's (8 bits) to a connection in Java
  format so they will be readable by Java.
  All data types in Java are signed, i.e. a byte can hold a value in
  the range [-128,127]. Trying to write a value outside this range
  will automatically be truncated without a warning.
