\title{Renames a file (or a directory) atomically/safely}

\description{
 Renames a file (or a directory) atomically/safely,
 by also asserting that it was successfully renamed without side effects.
 If failing to rename and overwrite an existing file, the original file
 is kept.
}

\usage{
\method{renameFile}{default}(pathname, newPathname, overwrite=FALSE, ..., verbose=FALSE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{pathname}{The pathname of the file to be renamed.}
  \item{newPathname}{The new pathname.
   If an emph{existing directory} and the source is a file, then the
   destination becomes \code{file.path(newPathname, basename(pathname))}.}
  \item{overwrite}{If \code{\link[base:logical]{TRUE}} and there exists a file with new pathname,
   then it is overwritten.}
  \item{...}{Not used.}
  \item{verbose}{See \code{\link[R.utils]{Verbose}}.}
}

\value{
