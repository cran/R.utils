\title{Writes a integer (32 bits) to a connection in Java format}

\description{
  Writes one or several integer's (32 bits) to a connection in Java
  format so they will be readable by Java.
  All data types in Java are signed, i.e. a byte can hold a value in
  the range [-2147483648,2147483647]. Trying to write a value outside
  this range will automatically be truncated without a warning.
