\description{
 Gzip/Gunzip a file.
}

\arguments{
 \item{filename}{Pathname of input file.}
 \item{destname}{Pathname of output file.}
 \item{overwrite}{If the output file already exists, then if
   \code{overwrite} is \code{\link[base:logical]{TRUE}} the file is silently overwritting,
   otherwise an exception is thrown.}
 \item{remove}{If \code{\link[base:logical]{TRUE}}, the input file is removed afterward,
   otherwise not.}
 \item{BFR.SIZE}{The number of bytes read in each chunk.}
  \item{...}{Not used.}
}

\value{
  Returns the number of (input) bytes read.
}

\details{
  Internally \code{gzfile()} (see \code{\link[base]{connections}}) is used to
  read (write) chunks to (from) the gzip file.
  If the process is interrupted before completed, the partially written
  output file is automatically removed.
}

\examples{
  cat(file="foo.txt", "Hello world!")
  gzip("foo.txt")
  print(file.info("foo.txt.gz"))
  gunzip("foo.txt.gz")
  print(file.info("foo.txt"))
  file.remove("foo.txt")
